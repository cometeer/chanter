# Chanter
An auctioning application/platform

This is an experiment to learn more about the limits of meteor's reactivity and the viability of doing realtime auctions with meteor. Currently the focus is only on automatically increasing/decreasing auctions with an immediate "buyout". This is mostly because it has the least problems with latency (client/server) and async oddities.
